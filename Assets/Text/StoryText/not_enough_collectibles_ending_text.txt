Perfect Humanity

Humans are creatures of adaptation. We learn and forget, create and destroy based on what the times require, taking one step after the next, our direction based entirely upon situation. 

You traversed time to discover the secrets of our creation to prevent our destruction. You have taken this journey in search of survival but walked the journey according to the needs of your own survival. 

Unable to unlock the final puzzle, you return with only the surface level understanding of what you have witnessed along the way. It was enough to form new theories but not enough to find the truth. 

Humans will die out but may rise again. But how long will they last?
