The Past and Future, All As One

Humans are creatures of adaptation. We learn and forget, create and destroy based on what the times require, taking one step after the next, our direction based entirely upon situation. 

By learning more about every step of humanity's existence, their culture, their beliefs and their ways of life, you have learnt, in turn, how the world had progressed through it all. Through this knowledge, you have unlocked the crucible to discover its secrets. 

It is the fate of the forest to burn. It is the fate of the old to make way for the new, for the ashes of the past to fertilise the ground upon which the future may grow.

The primitive way of life, of gathering only what we need from what we find was not a coincidence, but a conscious decision of people as advanced and more knowledgeable than we are. 

Our technologies have taken too much and there is no more room to grow. But with this knowledge of what cannot be sustained, we don't need to fade away alongside them. We can restart and be reborn on our own terms.

We, as humans, will continue, keeping none of our advancements except the knowledge we discovered. But how long will we remember what we know. And, if we forget, will we be able to rediscover it?
